OpenTenBase is an open-source project incubated and operated by the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation. It is an enterprise-level distributed HTAP database that features high scalability, compatibility with commercial database syntax, a distributed HTAP engine, multi-level disaster recovery, and multi-dimensional resource isolation. It has been successfully applied in the core business systems of various industries, including finance, healthcare, and aerospace.

Since its release, OpenTenBase has been favored by numerous high-quality users worldwide, with the European Space Agency being one of its important "fans." In its significant planetary exploration projects, the European Space Agency uses OpenTenBase as the core database for the "Gaia Mission," storing over 300TB of data. The Gaia Mission project team at the European Space Agency has maintained close attention and active interaction with the open-source community, becoming an important contributor to the community.

OpenTenBase has been refined for over 10 years in Tencent's internal businesses and external commercial scenarios such as social networking, gaming, advertising, and finance. It is perfectly suited for applications with massive data, high concurrency, high HTAP, and distributed transaction capabilities. The OpenTenBase database technically fills the gap in the industry for open-source distributed OLTP systems based on PostgreSQL, and integrates HTAP dual engines, distributed transaction consistency, high SQL compatibility, and complex query capabilities, providing strong support for enterprise digital transformation:

üöÄ In terms of the engine, OpenTenBase supports both OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) capabilities, effectively reducing the complexity and cost of business architecture;

üîí In terms of transaction consistency, a global transaction management node is introduced to manage distributed transactions, ensuring transaction consistency in a fully distributed environment through distributed transaction consistency technology;

üêò Highly compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle in terms of compatibility;

üîé In terms of querying, a newly developed distributed query optimizer can enhance the performance of complex queries by more than ten times.

**OpenTenBase User Cases Call for Prizes**

In order to allow more developers to engage with and experience open-source database technology, and to help users solve problems encountered in the business production process, the OpenTenBase open-source community, in collaboration with the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation, has launched a user case collection activity to co-build the domestic open-source database ecosystem. Outstanding cases are expected to be selected as "OpenTenBase User Cases by the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation," and will have the opportunity to participate in subsequent OpenTenBase open-source technology salons for in-depth exchanges with community technical experts.

**Case Requirements**

The content focuses on application cases developed by developers based on OpenTenBase. Submitted materials include, but are not limited to, the background, processes, and experiences of the application. It is recommended to share detailed steps for deploying applications using OpenTenBase in a combination of text and images, or to share experiences and tips for using OpenTenBase. The project solicitation is ongoing, and you can submit project content at any time through the channels below.

**Project Requirements**

Target Audience: Enterprise users, researchers, individual developers, student groups, etc. are all eligible. The project is required to use OpenTenBase open-source technology as the underlying support, and the project can be in the research phase, trial phase, or online phase

**Case Content Structure**

Following the principles of professionalism and practical case implementation, cases need to be structurally refined from multiple dimensions, including case background, objectives, solutions, problems solved, comparative analysis before and after, insights from the case, and the value significance of the case to the organization, in order to benefit the reader. The specific structural requirements are as follows.

üìö 1. Case Name

üè¢ 2. Introducer Company/Individual Profile
