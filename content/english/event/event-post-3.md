**On July 15**, the third stop of the cloud native open source project application practice session came to Shenzhen, which is famous for **"innovation" and "openness"**. Technical experts from **"DaoCloud Daoke", Tencent Cloud ｜ Tengyuan Club, Microsoft, OpenCloudOS community, WasmEdge community, DCE community** gathered together to share the most cutting-edge cloud native open source project information and discuss the latest cloud native technology trends.

**Peter Pan, Vice President of Research and Development of "DaoCloud", said in his opening speech that technology is never a single and independent existence. **Exchange and sharing can make technologies collide with each other and burst out with energy\*\*. A series of offline Meetup events like Lundao Native aims to give the audience a deeper understanding of all aspects of cloud native open source projects through the collision of ideas between cloud native and open source. This is a good way and a trend.

Facing the deployment trend of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, the open source community is blooming, and the emergence of many open source projects has brought diverse choices to users. During the event, **Zhang Xiao**, the leader of the large container team of "DaoCloud Daoke", shared the application scenarios, core capabilities and customer best practices of "DaoCloud Daoke" in multi-cloud and multi-cloud environments. Technical practical experience in the cluster field. Among them, CloudTTY, a project independently open sourced by "DaoCloud Daoke" and newly entered into the CNCF panorama, has received widespread attention. Zhang Xiao said that DaoCloud Enterprise is a product that brings together many excellent open source projects. "DaoCloud Daoke" opens some excellent open source projects to the open source community, allowing many enterprises and open source enthusiasts to enjoy the benefits of technology accumulation. dividends.

With the increase in application scenarios and data volume, distributed databases have become popular, and their advantages such as high availability, high scalability, and high cost performance are gradually emerging in business scenarios. **Tencent Cloud Database Senior Engineer Chen Zaini** introduced **TDSQL PG, an open source distributed database** with HTAP capabilities. It is **fully compatible with PostgreSQL and highly supports Oracle syntax**. At the event, Chen Zaini mentioned features that users are relatively concerned about, such as remote multi-activity, query optimization, partition tables, and distributed execution visualization, and explained the working principles in detail. She also analyzed application cases from WeChat Pay, the Public Security Department, and the European Space Agency. It shows how TDSQL PG helps users quickly build core business.

Zhang Shanyou "Dapr helps application modernization"

Nowadays, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for running distributed applications. So on top of that, how to improve developer productivity and make business development easier? **Microsoft Most Valuable Expert MVP,** **Zhang Shanyou, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Architect of Shenzhen Youhaoda Technology** mentioned Dapr, an open source project created specifically for distributed application runtimes. **Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime** that exposes encapsulated distributed capabilities for application calls through HTTP API, gRPC API and other language-independent ways, thus supporting the use of any language or framework for development and integration. Achieve the ultimate goal of democratizing cloud native development. Finally, Zhang Shanyou took China Merchants International CTOS as an example to demonstrate the key role of Dapr in the transformation of enterprises from traditional SOA architecture to cloud native.

Dai Qiuping "Technical Practice of Cloud Native Storage - Hwameistor"

As we all know, storage is the cornerstone of application operation. As cloud native enters all walks of life and stateful applications gradually become mainstream, cloud native storage also faces challenges. Based on years of practical experience in production, "DaoCloud" has independently open-sourced the **cloud-native local storage project--Hwameistor**. At the event, Dai Qiuping, senior product manager of "DaoCloud Taoke", introduced Hwameistor's rich data volume types, local storage high availability, local volume expansion, storage QoS restrictions, multi-dimensional migration of local volumes, and disk replacement And storage monitoring and other functional features, and also explained in detail the process of **one-click installation of Hwameistor** through the Operator. Interested friends can also try it by themselves! Currently, **Hwameistor has entered the CNCF sandbox** and is heading towards a new journey of cloud-native development.

Creating Cloud-Native Agents and Extensions for LLM by Michael Yuan

The birth of ChatGPT has set off an industrial upsurge of large language models, and various technical fields are facing new opportunities. Wasm, a new Internet celebrity in the cloud native community, is no exception. As a lightweight, portable and secure runtime, Wasm can further optimize the infrastructure under large model applications. **Michael Yuan (WasmEdge Maintainer) from the WasmEdge community** brought to the audience at the event site two demonstrations of **complete AI reasoning via Wasm instead of Python** and **completion of LLM agents creation via Wasm**. Wasm, a powerful tool for scalability, has moved from cloud-native scenarios to AI scenarios. As the tool chain continues to mature, there will be more technical opportunities waiting to be discovered in the future.

The essence of open source is to promote technological innovation through technological openness. The open collaboration of online developers is the foundation, and the open communication offline is also not to be missed. In the future, Lun Dao's original series of activities will also go to more places. Developers from all over the world are welcome to actively participate, and there are more exciting contents waiting to be explored.
